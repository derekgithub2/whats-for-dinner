# What's for Dinner? 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
This application allows users to randomly generate a side, main dish, dessert, or an entire meal. If a user doesn't know what to cook or what to eat, they can select an option of either a side, main dish, dessert, or entire meal and the application will display a random meal chosen from an array of options. 

### Installation Instructions:

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
This solo project was completed in approximately 15 hours over the course of 4-5 days. I am currently a Mod 1 student in the Turing program.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
- Gain experience building an application that utilizes HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Write HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
- Understand how to listen to and respond to user events
- Individualize your programming skill set

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
The first win I recognize from this project is being able to independently outline my logic and apply it to make a fully functional web application. I was also able to ask for help when I needed it and understand what solutions would best fit the problems I faced. The biggest challenege I faced was trying to implement stylistic changes via CSS. I found that I the way I structured the HTML made it very difficult to make specific changes to the contents through CSS. I was able to overcome these challenges by structually adjusting the HTML so that I could properly change the style of specific content within my application.
